This is the 2nd one, I use this database class for Dixie CMS and Katya CMS (version < 4.0).

This is still looks weird, but this is it, the personal custom portable database.

Now I have the API for this class, because this project is still continued as Dixie CMS still need it too.
Just take alook to the file: Ldb2.5-api.txt (plain text) or Ldb2.5-api.md

Feel free to use this class, but if you wanna use this class, please remind the license. Thank you.
